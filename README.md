Pathfinding Visualizer
This is a pathfinding visualizer tool built with React. The tool visualizes the process of finding the shortest path between a start node and a finish node using Depth-First Search algorithm.

Installation
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from here.

Clone the repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pathfinding-visualizer.git
Navigate to the project directory.
bash
Copy code
cd pathfinding-visualizer
Install the dependencies using npm.
bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the application.
bash
Copy code
npm start
Open the app in your browser.
bash
Copy code
http://localhost:3000
Usage
Choose a start node and a finish node by clicking on the corresponding squares in the grid.

Add barriers or walls to the grid by clicking on the squares you want to turn into walls.

Click the "Visualize DFS" button to visualize the Depth-First Search algorithm.

Watch the visualization of the algorithm in action as it finds the shortest path between the start node and finish node.

Future Updates
In future updates, we plan to add additional algorithms such as Breadth-First Search and A* to give users more options for finding the shortest path. We also plan to add additional features such as the ability to adjust the speed of the algorithm and the ability to generate random mazes for the grid. Stay tuned for updates!
